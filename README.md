# 🎯 Number Guessing Game 

## 📌 Overview
A simple console-based **Number Guessing Game** built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in C++.  
The program randomly generates a number between **1 and 100**, and the player tries to guess it.  

After each guess, the program gives helpful hints:
- 🔼 **Too high** → Guess is greater than the target number.  
- 🔽 **Too low** → Guess is less than the target number.  
- ✅ **Correct** → You guessed the number!
